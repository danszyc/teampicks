# Teampicks

Regardless of the sport, activity, or event, we often prefer to have fair teams. Suppose two team captains are chosen at random from a pool of players. 
In hopes of creating the best team, they take turns choosing the best player available. Team 1's captain gets first pick, then Team 2's captain picks the second best player, and the process repeats. But is this the method fair to Team 2? Suppose Team 2's captain is allowed to pick two players, the second and third-best players, then Team 1 picks one, and Team 2 picks one, and so on. Which method results in the fairest teams?

As it turns out, despite the alluring simplicify of the 121212 method, it's more fair to allow Team 2 to choose twice on their first turn. Doing so minimizes the `skill-diff`, or difference in average skill between two teams.
